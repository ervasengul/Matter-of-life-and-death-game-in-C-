How It Works

The program takes an integer n as input, representing the number of people.

A loop iterates through the list of people, eliminating every second one.

Each elimination is handled by a child process that prints the eliminated person's number.

The parent process waits for the child to finish before continuing the elimination process.

The last remaining person's number is displayed at the end.

Compilation and Execution

Compile the Program

gcc -o josephus josephus.c

Run the Program

./josephus

Sample Run

Enter the number of people (n): 5
Person 2 eliminated
Person 4 eliminated
Person 1 eliminated
Person 5 eliminated
The last remaining person is 3

Requirements

GCC compiler (for compiling the C program)

UNIX/Linux environment (as the program uses fork() and wait(), which are POSIX system calls)

Error Handling

If the user enters an invalid number (<= 0), the program prints an error message and exits.

If fork() fails, an error message is displayed and the program exits.# Matter-of-life-and-death-game-in-C-
